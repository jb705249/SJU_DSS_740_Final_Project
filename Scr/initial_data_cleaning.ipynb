    "**Initial observations of the numerical variables** - The dataset contains 45,000 records and provides insights into individuals' demographics, income, employment experience, and loan-related details. The average age of individuals is approximately 27.76 years, with a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 144 years, suggesting a likely data outlier at the upper end. Similarly, the person_income variable has a mean of about $80,319, but a maximum value of over $7.2 million indicates the presence of extreme outliers. Employment experience (person_emp_exp) averages around 5.41 years, though the maximum value of 125 years is likely unrealistic and could also be an error. Loan amounts range from $500 to $35,000, with a mean of approximately $9,583, while interest rates vary from 5.42% to 20%, averaging around 11%. The loan_percent_income, which represents the loan amount as a proportion of income, has a mean of 0.14. Credit history length and credit scores also show considerable variation, with the average credit score being 632 and ranging from 390 to 850. Lastly, the loan_status variable indicates that around 22% of individuals in the dataset received loan approval. Overall, the data shows strong variability, and several features may require cleaning or normalization due to the presence of clear outliers."

    "The skewness results for the numerical variables indicate that several distributions are significantly non-normal, with a strong tendency toward right skewness. Notably, person_income shows an extreme right skew (skewness = 34.14), suggesting the presence of a few individuals with very high incomes that distort the overall distribution. Similarly, person_age and person_emp_exp both exhibit strong right skewness (2.55 and 2.59, respectively), likely influenced by outliers such as individuals with unusually high age or employment experience values as mentioned earlier in summary stats. The loan_amnt and cb_person_cred_hist_length variables also display moderate right skewness, indicating that most applicants request lower loan amounts and have relatively short credit histories. In contrast, credit_score shows a moderate left skew (-0.61), suggesting a concentration of higher credit scores with fewer individuals having poor credit. Lastly, the loan_status variable is moderately right-skewed (1.34), reflecting an imbalance in loan approvals versus rejections, which may require attention during classification tasks. "

    "The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis indicates that there is no significant multicollinearity among the selected numerical features in the dataset. All VIF values fall well below the common threshold of 5, suggesting that none of the variables are excessively correlated with one another. Specifically, variables such as person_income, loan_int_rate, and credit_score exhibit very low VIF values, confirming their independence from the other predictors. While person_emp_exp and cb_person_cred_hist_length show moderately higher VIFs around 3, these values are still within acceptable limits and do not pose a concern. Overall, the dataset's numerical features are suitable for use  without the risk of multicollinearity distorting the results. Additionally, the par plot between the numerical columns further suggest no significant relationship amongst the columns. "
